#Update Ubuntu Package
•	apt-get update -y
•	apt-get upgrade -y

#Install HTTPS and Curl
•	apt-get update -y
•	apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl

#Step 1: Install Docker
#Kubernetes requires an existing Docker installation. If you already have Docker installed, skip ahead to Step 2.
#If you do not have Kubernetes, install it by following these steps:
#1. Update the package list with the command:

- sudo apt-get update
 
# Next, install Docker with the command:

- sudo apt-get install docker.io

#3. Repeat the process on each server that will act as a node.
#4. Check the installation (and version) by entering the following:


- docker ––version

#Step 2: Start and Enable Docker
#1. Set Docker to launch at boot by entering the following:

- sudo systemctl enable docker

#2. Verify Docker is running:

- sudo systemctl status docker

#To start Docker if it’s not running:

sudo systemctl start docker

#3. Repeat on all the other nodes.


#Install Kubernetes
#Step 3: Add Kubernetes Signing Key
#Since you are downloading Kubernetes from a non-standard repository, it is essential to ensure that the software is authentic. This is done by adding a signing key.
#1. Enter the following to add a signing key:

- curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add

#If you get an error that curl is not installed, install it with:

- sudo apt-get install curl

#2. Then repeat the previous command to install the signing keys. Repeat for each server node.
#Step 4: Add Software Repositories
#Kubernetes is not included in the default repositories. To add them, enter the following:

sudo apt-add-repository "deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main"

#Repeat on each server node.
#Step 5: Kubernetes Installation Tools
#Kubeadm (Kubernetes Admin) is a tool that helps initialize a cluster. It fast-tracks setup by using community-sourced best practices. Kubelet is the work package, which runs on every node and starts containers. The tool gives you command-line access to clusters.
#1. Install Kubernetes tools with the command:

- sudo apt-get install kubeadm kubelet kubectl

#2. Verify the installation with:

- kubeadm version

#kubeadm initialization

- kubeadm init

#Adding weavenet-

- kubectl apply -f https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/v2.8.1/weave-daemonset-k8s-1.11.yaml


- kubectl get nodes
